# ![Logo](logo.png) Horreum

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia;

> *A **horreum** (plural: horrea) was a type of public warehouse used during the ancient Roman period.*
> Although the Latin term is often used to refer to granaries, Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant Horrea Galbae in Rome were used not only to store grain but also olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing and even marble...

Following the ancient Roman correspondence Horreum, is an application to manage products and their stock informations.

## Architectural Design

Every application prone to the architectural changes while time goes on and needs changes
and Horreum no exception to that, to address those concerns Horreum uses [C4 Modelling](https://c4model.com/).

In order to keep the architectural changes manageable over time, I've used [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/)
to document architectural structure, they can be found under `docs/c4model` folder.

For the sake of the demo I only designed `System Context` and `Container` Level.

## Project Structure

Horreum uses [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for the structural design.

## Installation & Usage

If you have the docker installed you can just run the command below, and it will do the rest
```
docker-compose up
```

After you complete the installation steps Horreum spins up an http server
at the port `8080` you can just hit the link below to get start to use swagger:

http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html


## Key Concepts


### Services
There are 4 internal services:

- WarehouseService
- OrderService
- ArticleService
- ProductService

Which implements their own interfaces:

- WarehouseRepository
- OrderRepository
- ArticleRepository
- ProductRepository

All the services implements CRUD operations over their related Struct.


### Server

`api/server` package lets Horreum to spin up a HTTP and a Streaming server.

To handle the dependency injection it also introduces a Handler struct which
can be used through the application runtime.

```golang
type Handler struct {
	WarehouseService *warehouse.WarehouseService
	OrderService     *order.OrderService
	ArticleService   *article.ArticleService
	ProductService   *product.ProductService
}
```

### Rest API

Horreum uses Open API as api standard, every controller needs to have open api specs included
by design, to give you a quick info you can see the below:

> What is the OpenAPI Specification?
>
> The OpenAPI Specification, formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is the worldâ€™s standard for defining RESTful interfaces. The OAS enables developers to design a technology-agnostic API interface that forms the basis of their API development and consumption.
>

### Events

Aside from the CRUD operations; Horreum spins up an streaming message bus over channels
this helps Horreum to be more event driven.

Thus OrderService publishes a new Event whenever one of the below happens:

- OrderCreated
    - Handler: Decreases the product stock information accordingly
- OrderUpdated
- OrderDeleted
    - Handler: Increases the product stock information accordingly

To provide streaming bus feature Horreum uses the `github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill`
projects and wraps that under the `pkg/streamer` package.

### Migrations

Horreum uses `pkg/dbclient` package to handle migrations and database related tasks.

`dbclient` under the hood wraps up `github.com/upper/db/v4` package and provides orm-like
api to internal application.

Another aspect of the database is of course the managing the migrations, to do that
Horreum uses `github.com/pressly/goose/v3` package to manage them.

All the generated migrations can be found under the `pkg/dbclient/migrations` folder.

### Testing

Horreum uses `github.com/stretchr/testify` to handle assertion inside the tests
no need to mention that mocking is another important aspect of the testing to handle
that need Horreum uses `github.com/vektra/mockery` library which can automaticaly generate
mocks over existing interfaces.
